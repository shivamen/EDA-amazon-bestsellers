In this project I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis on Amazon's Top 50 bestselling books from 2009 to 2019.

I downloaded the dataset from Kaggle and tried to answer few questions like :
  - Top 10 bestselling books from 2009 to 2019 (fiction/non-fiction)
  - Top 10 bestselling authors from 2009 to 2019 (fiction/non-fiction)
  - Year-wise percentage category distribution of books
  - How many unique books and authors were included in bestsellers list from 2009 to 2019?
  - Most expensive book and most affordable book
  - Highest rated and lowest rated books
  - Does the Title length of the book matter to be a bestseller?
